# Early warning of incidents during protest demonstrations using Twitter

## Abstract of thesis

While most protest demonstrations remain peaceful, some of them become violent, resulting in possibly dangerous situations. Because there is positive relationship between social media use and protest participation, we propose to analyze incidents during protest demonstrations using social media data. In this study, a Twitter dataset is collected related to a Dutch demonstration where protesters did not comply with COVID-19 rules of the government. Following, an exploratory data analysis is performed to identify the phases of Twitter coverage after the incident. Additionally, machine learning models are trained to distinguish incident-related from non-incident related tweets. Furthermore, analysts at the Dutch national police force are interviewed to identify the information need when automatically detecting incidents during protest demonstrations. Lastly, an early warning system is created that automatically extracts tweets and detects incidents during protest demonstrations. The findings show unexpected results related to current research.

## Privacy disclaimer

Because citizens have the right to be forgotten, only the tweet ids of the tweets used for this project are shared in the folder "Original datasets". Moreover, all processed datasets are not shared within this public Github repository, because these datasets could contain personal information of citizens.
